DATABASE INTERACTION WITH MONGODB AND MONGOOSE

Steps

- Please, remember to run "npm install" in your Visual Studio Code terminal before opening this file.

- After creating a database, do the following using the Mongo shell:

1. Add a collection called “cars” and add at least five documents to your
collection. Assume that you will have some of the following
information for each car you add to your collection: The model, make,
colour, registration number, owner, and address.

3. Include another document that contains the following information:
■ Model: 2005
■ Make: Ford Fiesta
■ Owner: Sue Bailey
■ Registration: ABC 123 GP
■ Address: 13 Main Road, Johannesburg, South Africa.

5. Once you have added all the cars to your database, display all the
documents you have added.

7. Assume that Sue Bailey moves. Update her address to 21 Maureen Street,
Bluewater Bay, Port Elizabeth, South Africa.

9. Now assume that Sue marries and her surname changes to Smith. Update
your database accordingly.

11. Display all cars older than five years.
    
13. Create another document where there is another Ford Fiesta owned by
someone called Sue Smith.

15. Our original Sue Smith (Sue Bailey) has her car scrapped. Remove the
document that described her car from your database.
